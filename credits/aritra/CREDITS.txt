ChatGPT (4o) was used to aid in the coding of SEAC implementation and writing of the final report. The final code and the final texts were not directly the outputs of the model, as the outputs required serveral tweaks. Especially in code, serveral tweaks were required to achieve functional code. For more info, check out the associated EXPLANATIONS.txt. In all cases, the prompts were mostly one-shot, with a clear description of what needs to be done based on the project specs. If the output didn't work (as in most cases), manual coding intervention was performed, or the bugs were directly fed as input back to the model. As for writing, minor writing assistance was utlized to ensure clarity and grammatical coherency.
